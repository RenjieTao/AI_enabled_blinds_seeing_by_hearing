Artifical intenlligence (AI) technology is begining to make its way into vision applications in a wide range of industries, expanding on existing capabilities and opening up entirely new possibilities in vision. The rise of computer vision already shows great potential in self-driving vehicles, manufacturing robotics, medical diagnosis, agriculture, and safety surveillance (2).
