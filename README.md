# AI enabled blinds seeing by hearing

According to Gloabl Data on Visual Impairments report, World Health Organization, there are at least 2.2 billion people having a vision impairment, of whom at least 36 million of those were blind, 217 million peeople had moderate to severe visual impairment. The number of blind people increased by 17.6% from 1990 to 2015 (1).

The lose of eye sight makes a lot of challenges to blind people when facing life, such as navigating around places, societal stigma, finding and keeping a job, and enjoying their lives.

Artifical intenlligence (AI) technology is begining to make its way into vision applications in a wide range of industries, expanding on existing capabilities and opening up entirely new possibilities in vision. The rise of computer vision already shows great potential in self-driving vehicles, manufacturing robotics, medical diagnosis, agriculture, and safety surveillance (2).

The intuition of this work is to help blind people to "see" the world with the state-of-the-art computer vision technique. We developed a two-step neural network transfering a image into a audio clip, speaking out what is happening in the image. But deploying this algorithm to a live video, we can hearing, in real time, what is happening right in front of the camera. This neural network will help the blind people to "see" the world by "hearing".
