# AI enabled blinds seeing by hearing

According to Gloabl Data on Visual Impairments report, World Health Organization, there are at least 2.2 billion people having a vision impairment, of whom at least 36 million of those were blind, 217 million peeople had moderate to severe visual impairment. The number of blind people increased by 17.6% from 1990 to 2015 (1).

The lose of eye sight makes a lot of challenges to blind people when facing life, such as navigating around places, societal stigma, finding and keeping a job, and enjoying their lives.

Artifical intenlligence (AI) technology is begining to make its way into vision applications in a wide range of industries, expanding on existing capabilities and opening up entirely new possibilities in vision. The rise of computer vision already shows great potential in self-driving vehicles, manufacturing robotics, medical diagnosis, agriculture, and safety surveillance (2).

The intuition of this work is to help blind people to "**see**" by "**hearing**" the world with the state-of-the-art computer vision technique. We developed a **two-step** neural network, first transfer an image into a textual description, then transfer this caption into an audio clip, speaking out for the blind people to hear. By deploying this algorithm to a live video, we can hearing, in real time, what is happening right in front of the camera.
