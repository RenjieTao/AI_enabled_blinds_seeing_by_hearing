# AI enabled blinds seeing by hearing

According to Gloabl Data on Visual Impairments report, World Health Organization, there are at least 2.2 billion people having a vision impairment, of whom at least 36 million of those were blind, 217 million peeople had moderate to severe visual impairment. The number of blind people increased by 17.6% from 1990 to 2015 (1).

The lose of eye sight makes a lot of challenges to blind people when facing life. The major sensory organ of a person is his/her eyes. Timetables in train stations, signs indicating the right way or potential danger, a billboard advertising a new product in the market, there are all the visual types of information we all come across in our daily lifes. Most of this information is inaccessible for the blind and the visually impaired, inhibiting their independence, since access to information signifies autonomy.
